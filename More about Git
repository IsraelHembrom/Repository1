Git is used to store the source code for a project and track the complete history of all changes to that code. 
It allows developers to collaborate on a project more effectively by providing tools for managing possibly
conflicting changes from multiple developers. GitHub allows developers to change, 
adapt and improve software from its public repositories for free, but it charges for private repositories, 
offering various paid plans.
